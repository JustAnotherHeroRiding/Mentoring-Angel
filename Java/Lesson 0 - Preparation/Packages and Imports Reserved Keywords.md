Each Java package is the folder where the project is contained
As usual we have to import new type we want to use, such as `Date`, `LocalDate`, `LocalDateTime`
When we have two imports with the same name we use the FQN(Fully qualified name `java.sql.Date`)


## Reserved Keywords

- Keywords used for the language itself such as package, static, public, void, class
- We cannot name variables using these reserved keywords

## Arithmetic Operations
- using primitive data types we can perform arithmetic operations, such as int, floats, doubles etc

## The Math Class
- Similar to the javascript method that helps us to work with numbers


## Comparison Operators
- Same operators as in all languages, `==` for equality no triple equals as it is strongly typed

## Logical Operators
- Combining multiple boolean expressions
- `&&` for AND just as JS and `||` for OR
- `!` works as negation

## If statements and ternary operators
- Syntax is same as C/JS. if(condition){action}
- Ternary operators have the same syntax as JS when we only have a single if else statement

## Switch Statements
- Similar to if else but much more concise
