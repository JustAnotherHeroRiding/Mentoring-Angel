    <!-- Static:

    This is the default position for all elements.
    Elements are positioned according to the normal flow of the page, without any offset.

    Relative:
        
    An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position.
    Using top, right, bottom, and left properties, you can move the element from where it would be in the normal flow.
    Other content will not adjust to fit into any gap left by the element.

    Absolute:
        
    An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (not static). 
    If no positioned ancestors exist, it uses the document body.
    It's taken out of the normal flow, meaning it doesn't take up space and can overlap other elements.
    The top, right, bottom, and left properties position the element within its containing element.

    Fixed:
        
    An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport.
    It will stay in the same place even if the page is scrolled.
    The top, right, bottom, and left properties are used to position the element.

    Sticky:
        
    An element with position: sticky; is positioned based on the user's scroll position.
    It toggles between relative and fixed, depending on the scroll position. It's treated as relatively positioned until it crosses a specified threshold, at which point it is treated as fixed. -->
