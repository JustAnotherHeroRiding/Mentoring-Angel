    an entire row.
    As they are not block elements the parent does not recognize their height and the border is not stretched to be
    as tall as the taller div on the right -->

    <!-- Without the ::after pseudo element this p tag will go inside the container even though it should be on
    the next line.
    Adding the pseudo element will stretch the container div to the bottom of the tallest floated child
    And since the after element has a display: table; it will be a block element -->
